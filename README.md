# StreetFood - Project 5 🍔🍕

This is a fully functional interactive food ordering application built **entirely by me from scratch** using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript (ES Modules)**. No frameworks, libraries, or external help were used in its development.

## 🚀 Features

- 🍕 **Dynamic Menu Rendering** from a JavaScript array (`data.js`)
- ➕ **Add/Remove Food Items** to/from an order
- 🔢 **Quantity Adjustment** for each item (increase/decrease)
- 💰 **Real-Time Total Price Calculation**
- 💳 **Payment Form** with Input Validation for Name, Card Number, and CCV
- 🧾 **Order Confirmation and Loading Feedback**
- 🎨 **Responsive Layout** with clean, custom styling
- 🧠 Built with **semantic HTML** and accessibility in mind

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Structured and semantic markup
- **CSS3** – Custom styles, layout, responsiveness
- **Vanilla JavaScript (Modules)** – Interactivity, dynamic rendering, input validation
